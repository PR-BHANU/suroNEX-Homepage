## Design Philosophy

I have used a darked theme with a shade of black and shade of puruple for matching the Suronex Logo.

## Hero Section (What Suronex does)

Hero section gives the user the idea what Suronex does.

### Design Choices

- **Grid background** represents structure, systems, and interconnected system.
- **Radial glow** highlights the main message.

The grid fades into the background giving a smooth background change.

## Why Suronex Section

### Purpose

THis gives user why they should choose Suronex.

### Design Choices

- Centered content for focus.
- Scroll based animation for text fade in.
- Transparent Cards.
- Hover elevation and glow to signal interactivity.

## Compliance Coverage Section

### Design Choices

- A **single card (40+ standards)** instead of many small cards
- Transparent glass kind of card to visually separate importance

---

## Risk & Cost Section (Bento Grid)

### Purpose

To show the problems without Suronex

### Design Choices

- **Bento-style grid** like asked for more visual impact.
- Smooth fade in animations while scrolling and hover animations.
